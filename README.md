# Mathematics-and-Data-Modelling

This unit will build on the Mathematical and Data Modelling 1 and 2 units in the first two years of the engineering mathematics degree programmes and complete me thorough grounding in team-based mathematical modelling and problem solving applied to real world problems.

An external stakeholder will  present each project. Students will then be allocated to groups of 4-6 to work on each project.

During each project students will be trained in the problem solving approach, and work on and be guided towards and through particular mathematical/computational solution methodologies by the supervising academics. At the end of the phase each group of students will present their results and submit a written technical report.

Aims:

* To give students a thorough grounding in mathematical modelling and problem solving applied to real world engineering / applied science problems. The course will cover both model-centric and data-centric paradigms.

At the end of the course I will:

  * Have mathematically modelled a range of real world problems drawn from engineering, economics, and the physical, chemical and biological sciences.
  * Have experience of finding, reading and interpreting technical information.
  * Understand the mathematical modelling cycle, of model, analysis, prediction/interpretation, and iterative refinement.
  * Understand the differences between and relative merits of model-centric and data-centric paradigms.
  * Be able to identify and draw upon a range of appropriate mathematical and computational methodologies when presented with new and unfamiliar problems.
  * Have practised teamwork and time management.
  * Have learnt how to present and interpret mathematical results to/for a non-mathematical engineering audience.
  * Have experience of writing substantial technical reports
